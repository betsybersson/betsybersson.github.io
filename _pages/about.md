I am a postdoctoral fellow in [Tamara Broderick's](https://tamarabroderick.com/) group at MIT.
In May 2024, I received my PhD from the [Department of Statistical Science at Duke University](http://stat.duke.edu) under the supervision of [Peter Hoff](http://pdhoff.github.io).
My work is related to hierarchical modeling, covariance estimation, small area estimation, and conformal prediction.

<!---Broadly, I develop methodology that improves inferential precision in analyses with data obtained from multiple groups. I am particularly interested in developing straightforward methods that are robust to mis-specification without sacrificing usefulness. --->



Outside of statistics, I enjoy [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/86311097-bets-bersson), going on walks, particularly through [gardens](https://www.instagram.com/bs_fave_flowers/), and <s>vegetable gardening</s> (no yard in Boston).
