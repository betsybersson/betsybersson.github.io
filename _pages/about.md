I am a fifth year PhD student in the [Department of Statistical Science at Duke University](http://stat.duke.edu) working with [Peter Hoff](http://pdhoff.github.io). This summer, I worked in [Dr. Zhao's](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/bb/staff/zhao/index.cfm) group within the NIEHS Biostatistics and Computational Biology Branch. 

Broadly, I develop methodology that improves inferential precision in analyses with data obtained from multiple groups. I am particularly interested in developing straightforward methods that are robust to mis-specification without sacrificing usefulness. My work is related to covariance estimation, small area estimation, and conformal prediction.

Prior to coming to Duke, I worked on macroeconomic theory research with The Macroeconomic and Quantitative Studies group at [The Federal Reserve Board](http://federalreserve.gov).

Outside of statistics, I enjoy [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/86311097-bets-bersson), going on walks, particularly through [gardens](https://www.instagram.com/bs_fave_flowers/), and vegetable gardening. As Cicero [[said]](https://pages.pomona.edu/~cmc24747/sources/cic_web/cic_fam_9.htm), "If you have a garden and a library, everything will be complete." !
