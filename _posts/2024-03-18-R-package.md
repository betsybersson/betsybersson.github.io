<h3> R Package Resources </h3>

- [Simple notes to get started](https://tinyheero.github.io/jekyll/update/2015/07/26/making-your-first-R-package.html)

- [Releasing to CRAN chapter from Wickham/Bryan book](https://r-pkgs.org/release.html), but most useful is to just run `usethis::use_release_issue()` to initiate a GitHub issue with a checklist of to-do items for a CRAN release.

- [Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan's book](https://r-pkgs.org/)
