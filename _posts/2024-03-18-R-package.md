<h3> R Package Resources </h3>

- [Simple notes to get started](https://tinyheero.github.io/jekyll/update/2015/07/26/making-your-first-R-package.html)

- [Releasing to CRAN chapter from Wickham/Bryan book](https://r-pkgs.org/release.html), but most useful is to just run `usethis::use_release_issue()` to initiate a GitHub issue with a checklist of to-do items for a CRAN release.

- [Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan's book](https://r-pkgs.org/)

<h3> Random Notes </h3>

- To rebuild the package after making changes: `devtools::document()`

- Update packages listed in Imports in the DESCRIPTION file with the most recent version number: `usethis::use_latest_dependencies(overwrite = TRUE, source = "CRAN")`

- To propogate imported packages in the NAMESPACE auto-generated file, I created a `R/<it>package name</it>-package.R` file that includes the necessary packages with `@imports <it>package</it>` lines. See, e.g. [here](https://github.com/betsybersson/fabPrediction/blob/1b7d0b3fb6a2a7620ea2309ff3c9b20cedb8db14/R/fabPrediction-package.R).

- To be accepted by CRAN, your package must have 0 errors and 0 warnings. Notes are discouraged.

- Line to build and check package locally before CRAN submission `R CMD build . && R CMD check $(ls -t . | head -n1)`
